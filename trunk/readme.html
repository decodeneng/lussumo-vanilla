            <h2>Requirements</h2>
            <p>Vanilla is a PHP &amp; MySQL solution. You will need PHP version 4.1 or greater and MySQL version 3.23 or greater.</p>
            
            <h2>Before you begin</h2>
            <p><strong>If you are creating a fresh installation of Vanilla</strong>, all you need to do is upload all of the Vanilla files to your server. Once you are finished uploading, browse to the web-accessable folder where Vanilla is installed and you will be presented with the installer.</p>
            
            <p><strong>If you are upgrading from an existing version of Vanilla</strong>, here are a few things you should do first:</p>
            <ul>
               <li>
                  <strong>Back up your Database</strong>
                  <p>The upgrader will be performing structural changes on your database, you should have a backup of your old database just to be safe.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <strong>Back up your old Vanilla files</strong>
                  <p>Download and save your old Vanilla files to your local machine. Specifically, we can use your old appg/settings.php file for importing old settings.</p>
               </li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>When you are finished backing everything up, remove all of your old Vanilla files and upload all of the new Vanilla files to your server. Browse to the web-accessable folder where Vanilla is installed and you will be presented with the upgrader.</p>
