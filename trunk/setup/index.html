            <h2>Upgrading or Installing Fresh?</h2>
            <p>If you are attempting to install a new version of Vanilla, you've come to the right place...</p>
            <form id="frmFreshInstall" method="get" action="installer.php">
               <div class="Button"><input type="submit" value="Click here to install a completely fresh version of Vanilla" /></div>
            </form>
            
            <p>If you are attempting to upgrade your existing version of Vanilla, there are a few things you will need to do before you continue:</p>
            <ul>
               <li>
                  <strong>BACK UP YOUR DATABASE</strong>
                  <p>I cannot stress how important this step is. The upgrader will be performing structural changes on your database and you will <strong>not</strong> be able to just use the old Vanilla code with your database after you are finished upgrading. If something goes wrong with this upgrade procedure, you *must* be able to fall back to your old installation.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <strong>Save your appg/settings.php file</strong>
                  <p>You will need a backup of this file available so we can import your old configuration settings into the new system.</p>
                  <p>If you have already removed this file, do not panic. You will have the ability to reconfigure these settings during the upgrade.</p>
               </li>
            </ul>
            <form id="frmUpgrade" method="get" action="upgrader.php">
               <div class="Button"><input type="submit" value="Click here to upgrade your old version of Vanilla" /></div>
            </form>
