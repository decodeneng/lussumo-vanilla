======How to upgrade Vanilla======

=====Upgrading from Vanilla 1 to Vanilla 1.0.1=====

Assuming you haven't made any changes to the core Vanilla files, upgrading is easy. By "core Vanilla files", I am referring to all files NOT in the conf or extensions directories. All you need to do is:

  * Back up your current files *just in case*.
  * Download the new version from http://getvanilla.com.
  * Unzip the files to your local machine. 
  * Delete the extensions and conf folders on your downloaded, unzipped files. You do not want to copy the conf or extensions folders because you want your existing configurations and extensions to remain intact.
  * Back up any custom languages, themes, and styles you have installed.
  * Upload all remaining Vanilla 1.0.1 files on top of the Vanilla 1 files on your server. 
  * Re-upload your custom languages, themes and styles.

**Your Upgrade is Complete!**

=====Upgrading from Vanilla 0.9.2.x to Vanilla 1.0.1=====
